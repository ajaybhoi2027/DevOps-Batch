# DevOps Mastery: Day 1 - SDLC, DevOps Evolution & Linux Basics

## 📅 Overview
* **Goal:** Understand the "Why" of DevOps and the foundation of the Linux OS.
* **Project Case Study:** Citi Bank Car Loan Application (via Infosys).
* **Tools Used:** Sublime Text (Notes), Draw.io (Architecture).

## 1. The Linux File System Hierarchy
In Linux, "Everything is a file." The system is organized in a tree structure starting from the **Root (/)**.



| Directory | Name | Trainer's Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/` | **Root** | The base of the system. All files and folders originate here. |
| `/etc` | **Config** | The **"Brain"** of the server. Contains all configuration files (Networking, SSH, etc.). |
| `/var/log` | **Logs** | The **"Black Box"**. The first place to check when an application or server crashes. |
| `/bin` | **Binaries** | Contains essential user commands like `ls`, `cd`, and `pwd`. |
| `/home` | **Home** | The personal workspace for individual users. |

## 2. SDLC Evolution: Waterfall to DevOps
Software development evolved to meet the demand for high-speed, high-quality releases.



### **The Three Major Eras:**
1. **Waterfall (The Relay Race):** Linear and rigid. You cannot move to the next phase until the current one is 100% finished. **Risk:** High failure rate if requirements change late.
2. **Agile (The Sprint):** Iterative and fast. Developers build in 2-week bursts. **Problem:** Created a **"Wall of Confusion"** between Devs (who want change) and Ops (who want stability).
3. **DevOps (The Infinity Loop):** Bridges the gap. It is a culture of continuous collaboration, testing, and deployment.

## 3. "Champion of Tools" Strategy
We prioritize mastering the **Infrastructure** (The Assembly Line) before the **Glue** (Programming Languages).



### **The Toolchain Priority List**
1. **Git/GitHub:** The "Time Machine" for your code.
2. **Docker:** Standardizes environments (The "Shipping Container").
3. **Jenkins:** Automates the testing and building process.
4. **Terraform:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to build servers automatically.
5. **Kubernetes:** The "Captain" that manages and scales your containers.
6. **Ansible:** Configures and secures the inside of your servers.

> **Note:** **YAML** and **Python** are the "Glue." Master the tools first to understand the context, then learn the languages to automate the gaps.

## 4. Architecture Logic: 3-Tier Application
Using the **Citi Bank Car Loan** example, we visualize how data moves.



* **Presentation Tier:** The user interface (Mobile/Web).
* **Application Tier:** The logic (The code you write in Sublime Text).
* **Data Tier:** The secure database where loan records are stored.
