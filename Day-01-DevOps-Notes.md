## What We Learned on Day 1

Today’s session focused on understanding:
- SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
- SDLC phases with a real-world example
- Different SDLC models (Waterfall, Agile, DevOps)
- Why DevOps was introduced
- Importance of DevOps tools over programming languages

---

## What is SDLC?

SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.  
It is a structured process used to build software from idea to production and maintenance.

Every IT company follows SDLC to ensure:
- Proper planning
- Quality delivery
- Less risk and errors

## SDLC Example – Citi Bank Car Loan Application

Citi Bank wants to build a Car Loan Application.  
They approach Infosys to develop the software.

Infosys follows SDLC to understand requirements, design the system, develop the application, test it, deploy it, and maintain it after release.

---

## SDLC Phases

### 1. Requirement Gathering
This is the first phase where business discussions happen.

Infosys team discusses:
- What type of application is needed
- Who will use it
- What features are required

Car Loan Application requirements:
- User login
- Loan eligibility check
- EMI calculation
- Document upload
- Loan approval status

Output: Requirement document

---

### 2. Design Phase
In this phase, the system design is created.

Design includes:
- Application screens (UI)
- Application flow
- Database structure

Examples:
- Login screen design
- Loan application form
- Admin dashboard

Output: Design document

---

### 3. Development Phase
Developers write the actual code.

This includes:
- Backend logic
- Frontend code
- Database queries

Output: Application code

---

### 4. Testing Phase
Testing team verifies the application.

They check:
- Functionality
- Calculations
- Error handling

If bugs are found, they are reported to developers.

Output: Test report

---

### 5. Deployment Phase
The application is deployed to production.
End users can now access the car loan application.

---

### 6. Maintenance Phase
After deployment:
- Bugs are fixed
- Performance is improved
- New features are added

---

## SDLC Models

### Waterfall Model
- Linear and sequential process
- Each phase must be completed before the next

Disadvantages:
- Slow delivery
- No flexibility for changes

Used in projects with fixed requirements.

---

### Agile Model
- Work is divided into small sprints
- Continuous customer feedback

Advantages:
- Faster delivery
- Flexible changes

Limitation:
- Development and Operations teams still work separately

---

### DevOps Model
DevOps combines Development and Operations.

Key focus:
- Automation
- Continuous integration and deployment
- Faster and stable releases

DevOps follows a continuous lifecycle with no end.

---

## Why DevOps Was Introduced

Earlier problems:
- Developers said: "Code works on my system"
- Operations teams faced failures in production

DevOps solves this by:
- Improving collaboration
- Automating processes
- Using CI/CD pipelines

---

## Benefits of DevOps
- Faster software delivery
- Reduced manual work
- Fewer production issues
- Better system stability
- Continuous monitoring

---

## DevOps Tools and Their Purpose

| Tool        | Purpose                     |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Git         | Version control             |
| GitHub      | Source code repository      |
| Jenkins     | CI/CD automation            |
| Docker      | Containerization            |
| Kubernetes  | Container orchestration     |
| Ansible    | Configuration management    |
| AWS         | Cloud infrastructure        |
| Prometheus | Monitoring                  |

---

## Priority Rule (Important)

Trainer emphasized:
- First become strong in DevOps tools
- Then learn programming languages like Python or YAML

Reason:
- DevOps roles are tool-driven
- Programming languages are supporting skills

---

## Day 1 Summary
- SDLC is the foundation of software development
- Real-world projects follow SDLC phases
- Waterfall evolved into Agile and then DevOps
- DevOps focuses on automation and collaboration
- Tool mastery is more important than language knowledge
